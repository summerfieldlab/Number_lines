Now the real experiment will start.

Try to perform as best as you can: the higher your accuracy, the more money
you will earn (up to 5 pounds). Your bonus will be determined based on your
lowest accuracy between Task A and Task B.

You will go through 24 blocks that each last around 4 minutes. 
You can take a break in between.

Remember:
    - Task A:
        - Compare each coloured number to the preceding one.
        - Press UP arrow for HIGHER and DOWN arrow for LOWER.
    - Task B:
        - Indicate whenever a white number is equal to the last coloured
          number you have seen (SPACE BAR)

Please call the experimenter if you have any questions.
Good luck!
